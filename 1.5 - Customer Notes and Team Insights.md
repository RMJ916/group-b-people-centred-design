# Customer Note
* The stakeholders liked the idea that the website provided users the ability to add their own content but they were also concerned how people could be tempted to want to put their content on the site
* They also wanted that the website users be able to perform most of their tasks without requiring any kind of help from the admin
* The donation page needs to be diverse, in a way that donors are able to donate to particular flagship projects or organizations rather than donating to the RCE itself, since RCE Saskatchewan is not an incorporated body (which, as I understood, means that it is not able for RCE to accept donations in their own name)
* The customers liked the way the proposed design made it easier for someone to spot exactly how to contribute or get involved
* The design for the "Get Involved" Section was appreciated. However, it was felt that the name "Get Involved" could be reframed to something more welcoming. Some of the suggestions given were "Join our team" and "Become part of the RCE family"
* The customers liked our mobile-friendly design for some inner pages.

# Team Insights

* More focus should be made on making the design mobile-friendly/platform-independent since it meant much to the stakeholders.
* Desire to get knowledge about the trends in the user demographics, popular events, and similar insights was expressed by stakeholders. Therfore, efforts can be made to see if some of this can be achieved through the design
* We thinks that it is good idea to add donating volunteer button so people can donate their time for RCE
* They also concerned about giving push to connectivity to partners without competing other RCE site in globe. So, we try to improve our design in that way.
