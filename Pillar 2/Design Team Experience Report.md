# Project Description

The aim of this project was to design a high-fidelity prototype of the RCE Saskatchewan website using insights from stakeholder interactions and people-centered design concepts. 

# What went well?

By doing this project, we learn new things and methods regarding the prototype design of any website. We learn about people-centered design and how it helps in the real life of everybody. We learn to work in a team and individually. Then, we learn about low fidelity prototype, fast feedback cycle, MVP, User Mapping story board software and User story Mapping design for our project, and how to make Empathy Mapping in the first phase.

Then, Second Phase we learn about Adobe Xd software by following tutorials and videoes. It is an advanced software for making wireframe and high fidelity prototype. After that, we create a high fidelity prototype using Adobe xd. This is a long project but still in a short time we manage to give the appropriate proposal to RCE.
