# Project Description

* The aim of this project was to design a high-fidelity prototype of the RCE Saskatchewan website using insights from stakeholder interactions and people-centered design concepts

* This was to be fulfilled within a span of two months by following fast-feedback cycle, of which we completed one iteration (consisting of Pillar 1 and Pillar 2)

  * **Pillar 1** included the Observe, Frame, and Brainstorm phases of the fast-feedback cycle where activities like knowledge gathering, customer meeting, empathy mapping, affinity diagramming, and designing pen/pencil mockups were carried out. At the end of Pillar 1, notes were made based on customers' response to the low-fidelity mockups proposed by our team. Team insights were noted accordingly by discussion so that the next steps could be planned
  * **Pillar 2** consisted the final phase, Build, of the fast-feedback cycle where our team attempted to make a semi-polished high-fidelity prototype of our design using Adobe XD. Stakeholders were presented with this prototype and their opinioons were welcomed so that appropriate future work can be lined up

# What went well?

* By doing this project, we learned new methods regarding prototype design process of any website. We also learned about the importance of People-Centered Design and how it helps in designing real-life soultions
* We gained experience working in a team and individually.
* we learned in depth about important software design concepts like low-fidelity prototypes, fast feedback cycle, MVP, User Story Mapping, and empathy mapping in the first phase of the project.
* We also gained hands-on experience with software like StoriesOnBoard during this phase

* In second phase, we got the chance to learn about Adobe XD by watching its official tutorials and videos from YouTube. It is an advanced software for making wireframes and high-fidelity prototypes.
* The compressed nature of this class taught us important time management skills like planning and prioritization

# What could have been better?

The only things that we felt could have been better had they gone in a different direction were mostly unavoidable.

* The first, being the compressed nature of this class (2 months), which posed a challenge where we had very little to perfectionate our work. It also resulted in less time to get familiar with Adobe XD which made us compromise some of the features which we had planned to implement in our design
* The second inescapable obstacle was due to the current situation (arising from the COVID-19 pandemic) which did not allow our team to meet and work together. Due to this, we had to conduct virtual meetings and work at separate times on Adobe XD (since coediting was disabled on the free version of Adobe XD)

Overall, we felt that these hindrances helped us gained crucial skills like better planning and work-from-home.

# Future Work

* Most importantly, we can learn the advanced features of Adobe XD and design the features which we had to compromise during our intial high-fidelity design process
* Other than this, we can focus on areas like site security, design layouts like color, font style, and typography, and user-friendliness so that people can understand the site easily and use it comfortably
* Additionally, we can focus on making a responsive mobile-friendly/platform-independent version of our design for better outreach in all kinds of electronic devices like smartphones, tablets, desktops, and laptops
* Besides, we are also thinking about how users can be motivated to contribute to sustainable development by seeing our design and how they can experience fun using this website without becoming bored
* Also, we realized from the last customer meeting how we can utilize the RCE Saskatchewan logo colors in design for a better layout
* We have also agreed to add some other features like enabling event notifications and adding user testimonials based on the design presentations of our fellow group members
* At last , we can also ask ourselves what is the way to move to our design according to today's needs?
