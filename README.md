# Notes
1.  Piller 1
  * We both made empathy mapping invidually, then merged our ideas together using affinity diagramming in order to get a good start for drafting the Project definition document.
  * Afterthat, We used  the results from empathy mapping to  create user story mappings (USM). 
  * Then, we worked on designing Low-fidelity design mockups (Paper and pencil design) using concepts from topics learnt in class. 
  * In Addition, We also worked on preparing customer notes and writing insights following the last meeting with RCE members.
  
2.  Piller 2
  * We both work on pillar2 together.
  * First we both learned how Adobe Xd Work and make a list which feature we can use for our High-Fidelity prototype.
  * Then, we worked on designing High-Fidelity Design mockups through Adobe Xd using from topics learnt in class.
  * As well as, we do some correction as customer insights in last meeting and make design and presentation together for final project delivery.
