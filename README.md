# Notes
Piller1: We both made empathy mapping invidually then merge our idea together for getting proper idea about Project definition documentation. Afterthat, We use empathy mapping for create user story mapping (USM) generation. Then, we work on Low-fidelity design (Paper and pencil design) using lecture topics. In Addition, We work on customer notes and team insights documentation following last meeting with RCE members.
