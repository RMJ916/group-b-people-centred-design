# Notes
1.  Pillar 1
  * We both made empathy mapping invidually, then merged our ideas together using affinity diagramming in order to get a good start for drafting the Project definition document.
  * Afterthat, We used  the results from empathy mapping to  create user story mappings (USM). 
  * Then, we worked on designing Low-fidelity design mockups (Paper and pencil design) using concepts from topics learnt in class. 
  * In Addition, We also worked on preparing customer notes and writing insights following the last meeting with RCE members.
  
2.  Pillar 2
  * We both worked on Pillar 2 together.
  * First we individually learned how Adobe Xd works and made a list of features we can use for our high-fidelity prototype.
  * Then, we worked on designing different high-fidelity design mockups using Adobe Xd and topics learnt in class.
  * We also made some corrections based on the  customer insights from last meeting and then made design and presentation together for the final project delivery.
