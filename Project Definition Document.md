# Project Definition

(Ruff idea) Real problem here is that blogging and no sharing option for their blog, no facility for comment in any blog. As well as, how can we know current page name and after going down their is no bottom to top button for customer without scrolling whole page. In addition, there is no stiky menu on scroll page for customer so they can easily change page and login/sign-up without going up and bottom.
